# Bundle Deactivation Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Automatic Bundle Deactivation
When an individual item is sold or reserved, **ALL bundles containing that item are automatically deactivated**.

### 2. Items Remain Available
- Items in bundles now stay `status = 'available'`
- Items can be sold individually OR as part of a bundle
- No more `'bundled'` status that prevents individual sales

### 3. Database Trigger
Created `deactivate_bundles_on_item_sale()` trigger that:
- Monitors the `items` table for status changes
- Automatically sets bundles to `status = 'unavailable'` when any item sells
- Runs instantly when an item is marked as 'sold' or 'reserved'

### 4. Bundle Availability Check
Added `is_bundle_available(bundle_id)` function to check if all items in a bundle are still available.

## 📋 How It Works

### Scenario: Seller Creates a Bundle
1. Seller selects 3 items (Item A, Item B, Item C)
2. Sets bundle price at $50 (individual total: $80)
3. **Items remain visible and sellable individually** ✅
4. Bundle appears in marketplace

### Scenario: Individual Item Sells
1. Buyer purchases Item A individually for $30
2. **Trigger fires automatically** 🔥
3. All bundles containing Item A are marked as `unavailable`
4. Bundle no longer appears in marketplace
5. Item B and Item C remain available for sale

### Scenario: Bundle is Purchased
1. Buyer purchases the bundle for $50
2. Items A, B, and C are all marked as `sold`
3. Bundle status changes to `sold`

## 🗄️ SQL Migration Required

**You need to run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:**

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of:
-- supabase/migrations/030_deactivate_bundles_on_item_sale.sql
```

## 🚀 Deployed Changes

1. ✅ SQL migration file created
2. ✅ API updated (bundle creation no longer marks items as 'bundled')
3. ✅ Marketplace already filters by bundle status
4. ✅ Code deployed to Vercel
5. ⏳ **SQL migration needs to be run in Supabase**

## 🎯 Next Steps for You

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy the SQL from `supabase/migrations/030_deactivate_bundles_on_item_sale.sql`
3. Run the migration
4. Test by:
   - Creating a bundle with 2-3 items
   - Selling one item individually
   - Verify the bundle disappears from marketplace

## ✨ Benefits

- ✅ Sellers can sell items individually or in bundles
- ✅ No manual management needed - automatic deactivation
- ✅ Prevents overselling (can't sell item twice)
- ✅ Clear business logic: bundle only valid if all items available
- ✅ Better user experience - items don't get "locked up" in bundles

**Status:** Ready to use after SQL migration is applied! 🎉
