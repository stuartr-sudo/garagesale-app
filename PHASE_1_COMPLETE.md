## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:
1. ‚úÖ Run migrations 042 and 043 in Supabase
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Set all environment variables in Vercel
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Configure Vercel cron jobs for:
   - cleanup-expired-reservations (every 1 minute)
   - Future: close-promotion-auctions (daily at midnight)
   - Future: process-wish-list-matches (hourly)

## Key Business Metrics to Track

Once features are live:

- **Trading**: Proposal rate, completion rate, avg swap value
- **Wish Lists**: Creation rate, match rate, fulfillment time
- **Promotions**: Auction participation, CTR on promoted items
- **AI Features**: Usage rate, acceptance rate, time saved

## Competitive Advantages Delivered

‚úÖ **Already Built**:

2. In-platform messaging (engagement)
3. Foundation for trades & wishes (network effects)

üöß **In Progress**:
