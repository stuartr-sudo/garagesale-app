# ✅ Authentication Fix Applied!

The "Unsupported provider" error has been resolved by adding a dedicated sign-in page that uses **email/password authentication** (enabled by default in Supabase).

## 🎯 Changes Made

1. ✅ Created new `/SignIn` page with email/password authentication
2. ✅ Updated Home page to navigate to SignIn instead of OAuth
3. ✅ Added support for both Sign In and Sign Up
4. ✅ Included Google OAuth button (ready when you enable it)
5. ✅ Pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/base44dev/garage-sale-40afc1f5

   https://garage-sale-40afc1f5-q7c6vql6s-doubleclicks.vercel.app
   ```
3. Add to Redirect URLs:
