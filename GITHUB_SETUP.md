## 🔗 Connect GitHub to Vercel (Optional but Recommended)

Connecting your GitHub repo to Vercel enables **automatic deployments** whenever you push code.

### **Method 1: Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)**

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/doubleclicks/garage-sale-40afc1f5/settings/git

2. Click "Connect Git Repository"

3. Select "GitHub"

4. Choose repository: `base44dev/garage-sale-40afc1f5`

5. Click "Connect"

**That's it!** Now every push to `main` will automatically deploy.

---

### **Method 2: GitHub Marketplace**

If you don't see the repo in Vercel:

1. Go to: https://github.com/apps/vercel

2. Click "Configure"

3. Grant access to `base44dev/garage-sale-40afc1f5`

4. Go back to Vercel and try connecting again

## 🚀 Automatic Deployments

Once connected:
- ✅ Push to `main` → Auto-deploy to production
- ✅ Push to other branches → Preview deployments
- ✅ Pull requests → Preview URLs
- ✅ Automatic rollbacks on errors

---

## 📝 Git Workflow

### **Make Changes and Deploy**

```bash
# Make your changes
nano src/pages/Home.jsx

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update homepage content"

# Push to GitHub (will auto-deploy if connected)
git push origin main

# Or deploy directly with Vercel
vercel --prod
```

### **Create a Feature Branch**

```bash
# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b feature/new-design

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add new design"

# Push to GitHub (creates preview deployment)
git push origin feature/new-design

# Create pull request on GitHub
```
