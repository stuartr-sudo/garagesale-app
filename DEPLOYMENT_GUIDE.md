# üöÄ Deployment Guide - BlockSwap Platform

## Step-by-Step Deployment Process

### ‚úÖ **Step 1: Run SQL Migrations in Supabase**

1. Go to your Supabase project
2. Click on **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
3. Open the file `SUPABASE_MIGRATIONS_TO_RUN.sql` (in this repo)
4. **Copy the ENTIRE contents** of that file
5. Paste it into the Supabase SQL Editor
6. Click **Run** (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)

**Expected Result**: You should see "Success. No rows returned" - this is GOOD!

**What This Creates**:
- ‚úÖ 20+ database tables
- ‚úÖ All Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ‚úÖ Database functions and triggers
- ‚úÖ Indexes for performance
- ‚úÖ Comments for documentation

**‚ö†Ô∏è If You Get Errors**:
- If you see "already exists" errors, that's OK! It means some tables are already there
- If you see "column already exists", that's also OK!
- Only worry about errors like "syntax error" or "permission denied"

### ‚úÖ **Step 2: Set Environment Variables in Vercel**

Go to your Vercel project ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**

**Required Variables:**

```bash
# Supabase (should already be set)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-role-key

# OpenAI (for AI features)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-openai-key

# Cron Jobs Security
CRON_SECRET=your-random-secret-string

# Stripe (if using credit card payments)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your-stripe-key
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your-stripe-key

# Email (optional, for now)
# SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-key
# or
# AWS_SES_KEY=your-aws-ses-key
```

**How to Generate CRON_SECRET:**
```bash
# Run this in your terminal:
openssl rand -base64 32
```

**Where to Get Keys:**
- **OpenAI**: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- **Stripe**: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
- **Supabase**: Already in your project settings

### ‚úÖ **Step 3: Enable Vercel Cron Jobs**

Your `vercel.json` already has cron jobs configured:

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/collection-reminders",
      "schedule": "0 9 * * *"  // Daily at 9 AM
    },
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/cleanup-expired-reservations",
      "schedule": "* * * * *"  // Every minute
    },
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/process-wish-list-matches",
      "schedule": "0 * * * *"  // Every hour
    },
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/expire-trades",
      "schedule": "0 0 * * *"  // Daily at midnight
    }
  ]
}
```

**To Enable:**
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Cron Jobs**
3. Verify all 4 cron jobs are listed and enabled
4. If not, they'll auto-enable on your next deployment

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Make sure `CRON_SECRET` is set, or the cron jobs will fail!

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 4: Deploy to Vercel**

**Option A: Automatic (Recommended)**
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: Production deployment"
git push origin main
```
Vercel will automatically detect the push and deploy.

**Option B: Manual Deploy**
```bash
npm run build
vercel --prod
```

#### **Issue 2: Cron jobs not running**
**Solution**: 
1. Check `CRON_SECRET` is set in Vercel
2. Go to Vercel ‚Üí Functions ‚Üí Check for errors
3. Trigger manually: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/cron/process-wish-list-matches?secret=YOUR_CRON_SECRET`
